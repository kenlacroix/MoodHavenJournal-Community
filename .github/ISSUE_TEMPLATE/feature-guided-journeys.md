**User Story**  
As a user, I want multi-step reflection flows (e.g. Morning Check-In) so that I can dive deeper.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] “Journeys” tab lists available flows.  
- [ ] Clicking one opens a sequence of 3–5 prompts in the modal.  
- [ ] Display progress indicator (e.g. “Step 2 of 4”).  
- [ ] Users can cancel or resume incomplete journeys.

**Mockup/Design**  
_Include screenshot or link to mockup here._

**Notes**  
- Consider state management for active journey.

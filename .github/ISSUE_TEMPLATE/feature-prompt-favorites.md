As a user, I want to star/save prompts so that I can revisit my favorite reflections later.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] “★” icon displayed on each prompt card.  
- [ ] Toggle saved state (filled vs. outline star) on click.  
- [ ] Persist favorites in localStorage (key: `muse-favorites`).  
- [ ] “Favorites” view in menu lists saved prompts (max 50).  
- [ ] Removal from favorites possible in that view.

**User Story**  
As a user, I expect Muse to meet WCAG standards for roles, labels, and focus indicators.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] Audit with AXE or Lighthouse.  
- [ ] Add/verify ARIA labels on all controls.  
- [ ] Ensure custom focus styling and keyboard navigation.

**Notes**  
- Use `@axe-core/react` for checks.

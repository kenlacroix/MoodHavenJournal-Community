> *Thanks for all the early support — it means the world as MoodHaven Journal takes shape.*

Here’s a look at what’s ahead:

## Mobile Companion App

A simple, encrypted-first mobile app is on the roadmap.

It will sync only fully encrypted blobs to your self-hosted cloud — no server dependencies, no decrypted data outside your device.

## Insights and Charts Plug-in System

MoodHaven will offer optional local plug-ins for generating insights and charts based on your entries — without ever exposing your private data.

You'll be able to install only the ones you want, keeping your journal experience light, focused, and under your full control.

## Expanded Backup Options

In addition to S3-compatible clouds (like MinIO, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Spaces), we’re exploring support for:

- **WebDAV targets** (Nextcloud, self-hosted servers)  
- **Rsync-friendly** backup destinations  

More flexible, more private.

## Lightweight Docker Compose Package

For users who want easier self-hosting, we'll offer a Docker Compose file that sets up MoodHaven’s encrypted store with minimal effort.

Bind volumes, secure your keys, and host your data — no proprietary middlemen involved.

Every feature we add will stay true to the MoodHaven philosophy:

**Local first. Encrypted first. User first.**

Thanks again for believing in tools that respect your thoughts, your privacy, and your freedom.

**Big things ahead.**

> *Because your thoughts should belong to you — not to us, not to anyone else.*

In a world where most apps quietly harvest your behavior, sell your habits, or lock you into platforms you don’t control —  

**MoodHaven was built around a different belief:**

> Your private reflections deserve private spaces.

Privacy isn’t a feature we bolt on later.  

Own your reflections — subscribe to MoodHaven Journal.

It’s the foundation everything else is built on.

### Here’s what privacy means at MoodHaven:

#### No tracking.  
No telemetry. No analytics. No third-party SDKs.  

MoodHaven never calls home — not even anonymously.

#### No vendor lock-in.  
Your encrypted journal stays on your machine or your cloud.  

You choose where it lives — and you can move it anytime.

#### No gimmicks.  
No hidden settings. No dark patterns. No fine print.  

What you see is what you get: real offline-first, encryption-first journaling.

We believe that owning your data isn't radical.  
It’s the **minimum standard of respect.**

**Your thoughts. Your privacy. Your freedom.**

That’s what MoodHaven stands for — today, tomorrow, and always.
